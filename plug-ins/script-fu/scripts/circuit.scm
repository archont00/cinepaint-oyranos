;  Genrates what looks a little like the back of an old circuit board.
;  Looks even better when gradmapped with a suitable gradient.
;
; This script doesnt handle or color combos well. ie, black/black 
;  doesnt work..
;  The effect seems to work best on odd shaped selections because of some
; limitations in the maze codes selection handling ablity
