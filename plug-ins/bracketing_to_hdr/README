Plug-in to create an HDR image from a series of bracketed exposures.

Tutorial: http://people.freenet.de/hsbosny/HDR_Tutorial

Programmer's notes:
==================
The plug-in consists of a GUI-independent "computing kernel" and a GUI
layer. For the plug-in GUI we use the toolkit Fltk, whereas the CinePaint
main programm was written in Gtk. So we have some interfaces, reflected by
a directory structure as follows:

./         - Main source file of the plug-in. Here resides the only file with
              explicite references to the Gtk-CinePaint: "bracketing_to_hdr.cpp".

./br_core/ - The GUI independent "computing kernel".

./gui/     - The Fltk-depending GUI stuff.

./FL_adds/ - General additions to Fltk like Greg Ercolano's Fl_Table and my
              Fl_Cartesius, see ./gui/README.

./TNT/	   - Subset of the 'Template Numerical Toolkit'. TNT-files are included
 	      by ./br_core/ and ./gui/ files via "TNT/___", i.e. the local
              makefiles in ./br_core/ and ./gui/ must have the TNT dir in their
              include path (eg. via "-I.."). License and source link see any
              TNT file header.

Documentation:
=============
The source code is documented in the doxygen style. Use the program `doxygen' to
create a code documentation from the sources. Doxygen is available from

	http://www.doxygen.org/

To make the documentation, cd to this directory and type:

	doxygen

The doxygen output will be in the ./html/ subdirectory. To read it just point
your browser at the "index.html" file. The generated doxygen output is
controlled by the "Doxyfile" file (output language, call graphs, included/
excluded files etc). You can edit "Doxyfile" directly or you can use the
GUI frontend `doxywizard'. Doxywizard is available also from the above site.
