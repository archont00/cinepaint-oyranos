TODO list for CinePaint plug-in "bracketing_to_hdr"
Last revision: 2006/10/07

See the TODO and BUG lists in the doxygen output. Generation of doxygen output
is described in the README file.

In addition:
- Instead of the Sammelsurium file "gui_rest.cpp" it would be better to have
   one file per class declared in gui.fl like "gui_MainWinClass.cpp", 
   "gui_TestSuiteWinClass.cpp" etc.
