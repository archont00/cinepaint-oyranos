The actual and original README (c) Olivier Tharan (he's a friend of mine, yep)

Let me introduce myself... 
--------------------------
My name is dbbrowser, but I have been known in my youth as dblist, almost as
of version 0.05! I am an extension for the Gimp and my purpose is to display a
list of all the procedures that have registered themselves in the procedure
database. The main thing I do is a gimp_query_procedure and a pair of
gimp_query_database. 

What can this marvel do ? 
-------------------------
The dbbrowser window is divided into two parts. On the left, you have a
scrolling list containing the names of all the procedures registered within
Gimp. When you click on one of them, its name, description and author(s) are
displayed on the right side, altogether with the types and parameters the
procedure takes and what it returns. 

All this is rather brilliantly completed by two search buttons, one for a
by-name search, the other one for a by-blurb search. Just enter any regexp you
have in mind in the text widget beneath the list and click on the appropriate
button; the results of the search are automagically displayed in the scrolling
list. 

Even fancier: script-fu-console integration 
-------------------------------------------
dbbrowser comes handy with a patch for script-fu-console.c which adds a button
named ``Browse'' to the right of the console text widget. Clicking on the
button launches dbbrowser from which you still can choose any procedure. But
in the dbbrowser window, a fourth button has appeared, appropriately named
``Apply'', for its goal is to take the selected procedure and its arguments,
and insert them into the script-fu console command line. It would save
developers a great deal of pain to debug their scripts (or even to develop
some!)

(the following had been written by me, so, it's not *really* in english :)

INSTALL

These files go to gimp-xx.xx.xx/plug-ins/dbbrowser. That does not
erase the files "Makefile*", so the plug-in is easy to re-compile : just
do a  "make" in this directory. Then, "make install" (as root)
to install the plug-in. 

If it breaks, wait for GIMP 1.0 :) (or mail to <thomas@minet.net>)

BUGS/TODO

- refresh problem for the scrolled list (as in gtkfileselection)
- add the "help" field (I wait for a "usable" gtk_text)
- arg... well... my english is too bad to explain my others ideas :)
