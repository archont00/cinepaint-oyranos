	* gimpmodule.c (newpfobject): use correct type for enums

	* plug-ins/gtkcons.py (Console.run): set _ after evaluating a 
	statement, so _ may be used as it is in the python interpreter.

2000-09-20  Kevin Turner  <acapnotic@users.sourceforge.net>

	* plug-ins/pdbbrowse.py (pars): Oops.  When we did
	s/PARAM_/PDB_/, we forgot to do s/6/4/ (the length
	of the prefix changed).

	* gimpmodule.c: Filter this through remove_cruft,
	finishing the libgimp renaming (and further ensuring
	that it won't work with older libgimps).

2000-08-10  Kevin Turner  <acapnotic@users.sourceforge.net>

	* gimpenums.py: This file now autogenerated by
	tools/pdbgen/enumcode-py.pl

	* gimpfu.py: 
	* gimpmodule.c: renaming fixes for libgimp 1.2

	* plug-ins/pdbbrowse.py (pars): s/PARAM_/PDB_/

2000-08-09  Kevin Turner  <acapnotic@users.sourceforge.net>

	* gimpmodule.c (chn_getattr): under "layer", remove the call to
	gimp_channel_get_layer_id() as this function does not exist.  It
	would be well for someone who knows pygimp better than I to review
	this change, but it keeps pygimp from being *completely* broken.

1999-11-11  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* doc/pygimp.sgml: updated documentation.

	* gimpmodule.c: applied patches from Hans Breuer to fix portability
	problems and also win32 compatibility.

	(lay_getattr): take is_rgb as a synonym for is_color/is_colour.
	(drw_parasite_attach):
	(drw_parasite_detach): change to new naming scheme.
	(img_parasite_attach): 
	(img_parasite_detach): same here.
	(gimp_Parasite_find): 
	(gimp_Parasite_attach): 
	(gimp_Parasite_detach): same here.
	(chn_getattr): added is_rgb as a synonym for is_colour, and
	is_layer_mask as a synonym for layer_mask.

1999-07-08  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* plug-ins/shadow_bevel.py: added {disable,enable}_undo() calls.  Also
	made it possible to turn off the creation of a shadow.

	* plug-ins/foggify.py: added disable_undo() and enable_undo() calls
	round the plugin code.

	* plug-ins/Makefile.am: forgot to add foggify and shadow_bevel to
	the EXTRA_DIST list.

	* gimpui.py: fixed some small bugs that caused an exception when
	loading on some versions of python.  Weird thing is, it did not
	cause problems on my computer (using 1.5.1)

1999-07-05  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* plug-ins/foggify.py, plug-ins/shadow_bevel.py: two new example
	scripts.

1999-07-04  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* gimpmodule.c: added support for parasites.  This new code is
	conditionally compiled if GIMP_HAVE_PARASITES is defined.
	Added other gimp 1.1 features to gimpmodule.

1999-07-03  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* gimpmodule.c (initgimp): added {major,minor,micro}_version constants
	to gimpmodule.
	(*) removed all the empty __doc__ strings -- they were just wasting
	space, and I have other docs in there now.

	* plug-ins/clothify.py (python_clothify): same here.

	* plug-ins/sphere.py (python_sphere): some small hacks to get the
	plugin to work with both gimp 1.0 and 1.1 -- using the pattern
	"if pdb.gimp_whatever.nparams == n" to check if the img parameter
	should be removed.

	* plug-ins/pdbbrowse.py (BrowseWin.extension_pdb_browse): fixed
	small bug.

1999-07-02  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* plug-ins/whirlpinch.py (python_whirl_pinch): adjusted plug in to
	work with drawable changes.

	* gimpmodule.c: removed the drawable type -- now only layer or channel
	types are used.  Also moved the drawable type's methods to both the
	layer and channel object types.  Also added some of the attributes of
	the drawable object to layer and channel objects (some aren't needed
	anymore, since layers are clearly defined as layers, and channels
	as channels).
	Make tile and pixel region objects keep a reference to their
	associated drawable.
	Added attributes has_alpha, is_colour, is_grey and is_indexed to
	layer and channel objects.

1999-06-22  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* gimpplugin.py: renamed from plugin.py.  This is mainly to reduce
	namespace polution.
	
	* getvals.py: removed file.  It has been replaced by the much more
	functional gimpfu module.

	* plug-ins/gimpcons.py: added a browse button that will display the
	pdbbrowse window, which can then be used to choose a pdb function.
	The selected pdb function gets its prototype inserted on the
	command line.

	* plug-ins/pdbbrowse.py: converted to use GTK+ widgets and gimpfu.

	* plug-ins/gimpcons.py: converted to use gimpfu and gtkcons.py.
	
	* plug-ings/gtkcons.py: a GTK replacement for tkcons.py.
	
	* plug-ins/whirlpinch.py, plug-ins/sphere.py: converted these two
	to use gimpfu.
	
	* gimpshelf.py (shelf): some changes so that the gimp internal types
	will pickle correctly.

	* gimpmodule.c (initgimp): export the type objects for gimpmodule's
	internal types.  This is mainly to help get pickling to work
	correctly.
	(_id2*): new functions to help convert id's to the builtin types.

	* plug-ins/clothify.py: converted to use gimpfu module.

1999-06-21  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* gimpfu.py: a simplified interface to writing GIMP plugins.  It
	handles all the user interaction stuff and saving the last used
	values.  It uses pygtk, so should match the interface of the rest
	of gimp.

	* gimpui.py: new file that implements a number of useful widgets
	for use with the interfaces of plugins.  It requires pygtk.

	* gimpmodule.c (tuple_to_GParam): accept None for layer, channel
	or drawable arguments to PDB functions.  This value gets treated
	like an ID of -1.
	(img_cmp, lay_cmp, chn_cmp, drw_cmp): added compare functions so
	that the == operator works as expected with those object types.
