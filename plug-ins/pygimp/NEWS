pygimp-1.2:  26-January-2000
	- Taken from gimp CVS tree and built as a separate package, as
	  it hasn't been included in gimp releases for a long time,
	  and we need a package that works with 1.2.
	- Mainly maintenance bug fixes to account for changes in gimp.
	- Various improvements by Kevin Turner.

pygimp-0.5:  8-July-1999
	- Fixed some bugs that I missed in gimpui.  It should actually work
	  on other people's systems now (I don't know why it worked on mine).
	- Included the foggify.py and shadow_bevel.py plugins in the package.
	- Added a timeout function to flush the displays in the gimpconsole
	  plugin.  This way you can see the results of what you type easily.

pygimp-0.4:  5-July-1999
	- Removed the drawable type -- now layer or channel objects are used
	  in its place.  All drawable methods have been transfered to both
	  the channel and layer objects.  The layer and channel objects have
	  the following attributes in common:
	    ID, bpp, has_alpha, height, image, is_color, is_colour, is_gray,
	    is_grey, is_indexed, mask_bounds, name, offsets, opacity
	  This means that the gimp.drawable(layer|channel) command is gone,
	  and so is the gimp.layer(drawable) and gimp.channel(drawable)
	  syntaxes (the gimp.layer and gimp.channel commands still exist).
	  I made this change because the previous setup was confusing, and
	  more complicated than it needed to be.
	- Removed all tkinter code, and replaced it with pygtk code.  There
	  is now also a convenience module gimpfu, which is a simpler
	  interface to 

pygimp-0.3:  8-February-1999
	- Some small build cleanups.  Now you should be able to do the normal
	  ./configure ; make ; make install.  It should compile fine with
	  GIMP 1.0 (I haven't tested 1.1 series though).
	- gimpmodule.c now prints exception messages, so now exceptions caused
	  by a plugin will print a stack trace to stdout, and cause gimp to
	  realise the plugin failed.
	- The disable_undo and enable_undo methods of image now use the
	  stack based enable/disable functions.
	- Added function names to PyArg_ParseTuple calls, so exceptions
	  are a little easier to understand.
	- added a spec file for building RPMS for this package.
	- added gimp.extension_ack, gimp.extension_process,
	  gimp.install_temp_proc and gimp.uninstall_temp_proc which will be
	  useful to implement an interface similar to script-fu's (ie. one
	  copy of python running in the background, responding to requests
	  from the gimp process every now and again).
	- changed over to using glib's safe memory allocation routines g_new,
	  g_strdup and g_free.
	- Converted documentation to docbook -- linuxdoc is just about dead.

pygimp-0.2.0: 19-Nov-1997
	- implemented pixel regions.  You can access them as a mapping.  (ie.
	  pr[x,y] is get_pixel, pr[x1:x2,y] is get_row, pr[x, y1:y2] is get_col
	  and pr[x1:x2, y1:y2] is get_rect)
	- to demonstrate the use of this low level object, I have included a
	  translation of the c plugin Whirl and Pinch.
	- fixed a problem where I didn't check for a NULL when parsing
	  arguments for a plugin.  This caused a crash when you ran a plugin
	  that took a string as an argument was run in interactive mode.

pygimp-0.1.0: 18-Nov-1997
	- first public release.
	- implements images, layers, channels, drawables, tiles, and just about
	  everything except pixel regions.
	- I have included a number of example plugins:
		- gimpcons is an interactive python console
		- pdbbrowse is a browser for the PDB
		- clothify is a translation of the Script-Fu script
		- sphere is a translation of the Script-Fu script
