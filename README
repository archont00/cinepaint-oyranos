This source code of CinePaint

x is based on code, which used to be hosted by Kai-Uwe Behrmann on
  Oyranos GIT server until 2014, latest version was numbered as
  CinePaint 0.25.

x includes additional patches to make it compile with Arch Linux.
  ( https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cinepaint-oyranos )

x exists only to provide a tool for the ICC Examin plugin, which is
  a nice standalone program, however, its functionality is greatly
  extended when used within CinePaint.

The code earlier maintained by Kai-Uwe Behrman was probably forked off
the original CinePaint 0.22. The purpose was proper interaction with
Oyranos and ICC Examin.

The original CinePaint source tarballs linked on www.cinepaint.org do not
work with ICC Examin anymore. Robin Rowe released a new version 1.0.4,
which despite the different version number is only a maintenance release.

The newly released version 1.0.4 on www.cinepaint.org is already quite
different to Kai-Uwe's last version 0.25. There are no plans to port
changes in the original 1.x series to cinepaint-oyranos.

CinePaint is a painting and retouching tool primarily used for motion 
picture frame-by-frame retouching and dust-busting. It was used on THE 
LAST SAMURAI, HARRY POTTER and many other films. 

CinePaint runs on all popular flavors of Linux and on Mac OS X as an 
X11 application. The Windows port of CinePaint is currently broken, 
sorry.

CinePaint is different from other painting tools because it supports 
deep color depth image formats up to 32 bits per channel deep. For 
comparison, GIMP is limited 8-bit, and Photoshop to 16-bit. 

CinePaint was originally based on GIMP and consequently is a GTK1-based 
application. A new FLTK-based version of CinePaint, called Glasgow,
is nearing alpha. There's also a new image core in development, called 
img_img, That will enable CinePaint to operate on images from the 
command-line and to integrate with other projects such as Blender.

Support from the film industry launched development in 1998. Motion 
picture technology company Silicon Grail (later acquired by Apple) and 
motion picture studio Rhythm & Hues led the development, with a goal 
of creating a deep paint alternative to the recently discontined SGI 
IRIX version of Adobe Photoshop and to support the emerging Linux 
platform. Although continuously in use in the film industry, it 
never had much awareness in the open source community. On July 4, 
2002, Robin Rowe released CinePaint as a SourceForge project.
