CinePaint 0.25.2 should generally work fine. Here is a list of known
bugs:

1) In locale other then "C", CinePaint may crash (buffer overflow) when  
entering File / Preferences or when trying to choose an ICC Profile from
a drop-down list (Image / ..).

Workarounds (any should work):

* Try to find out, which ICC Profile causes the crash and remove it
  from ICC Profile PATH.

* Run CinePaint w/ default "C" locale:
  $ LANG=C cinepaint

* Recompile CinePaint with --enable-debug (it can make it run slowlier)


PATCHES ARE WELCOME!
