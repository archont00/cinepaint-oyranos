CinePaint 0.25.2 should generally work fine. Here is a list of known
bugs:

1) In locale other then "C", CinePaint may crash (buffer overflow) when  
entering File / Preferences or when trying to choose an ICC Profile from
a drop-down list (Image / ..).

Two workarounds:

* Either try to find out, which ICC Profile causes the crash and remove it
  from ICC Profile PATH.

* Or run CinePaint w/ default "C" locale:
  $ LANG=C cinepaint


PATCHES ARE WELCOME!
