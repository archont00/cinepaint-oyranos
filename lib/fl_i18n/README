The fl_i18n is a library to include in your project.

fl_i18n helpes with setting up locale information on Linux and osX. It needs the GNU i18n tools, which's main part is linkable under the LGPL license.

Translations and functions for the filechooser in one language are included. Please post enhancements so other can benefit too.

Code is available under the FLTK license, but needs further linking against LGPL code.

One option exists to make the translation thread safe.
You have to define HAVE_PTHREAD_H in the fl_i18n.cxx file.



USAGE:

  Include the fl_i18n.H header file in you source files and use the functions
  there.

  Let you build system dig into the fl_i18n.xxx directory and do a make there.

  Link you executeable / library against the statical build libfl_i18n.xx
  library.

  Example is included.
