Building from Sources:

fl_i18n depends on following libraries:

  # FLTK version >= 1.1.4
  # for osX only (since version 0.30) install GNU gettext (and libiconv?)

For building unpack the tgz file in you project directory.
configure by hand in Makefile and
do a make:
    #make

Link your applications against the build static library in the fl_i18n_xxx directory.
