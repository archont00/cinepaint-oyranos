# This is your personal cinepaintrc file.  Any variable defined in this file
# takes precedence over the value defined in the system-wide cinepaintrc:
# @cinepaintdatadir@/cinepaintrc
#
# Take a look at that file if you want to see some of the options that
# can be set here.

# Most values can be set automatically within cinepaint, if you press
# the "save" button after changing some options in the Preferences
# dialog box.  You can also edit this file by hand, and cinepaint will
# always try to do the right thing when saving new options after you
# have edited this file.
